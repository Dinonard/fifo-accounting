//! First-In First-Out (FIFO) asset management system.
//!
//! This module provides FIFO asset management to help calculate the cost basis of assets.
//! It's used to calculate the capital gains tax for the assets.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! When asset is swapped for another asset, do the following:
//!
//! 1. Starting from the beginning of the list, find the first transaction that can satisfy the swap.
//!    Swap can be satisfied if output of the transaction is the same as the input of the swap.
//!    Transaction must have remaining _amount_ that can be _consumed_.
//!    Amount can only be consumed **once**.
//!
//! 2. Compare the amount of the transaction with the amount of the swap.
//!    a) In case the output amount equals that of the swap, consume it entirely.
//!    b) In case the output amount is greater than that of the swap, consume only the amount of the swap, leaving the rest for future swaps.
//!    c) In case the output amount is less than that of the swap, consume the entire output amount and continue looking for the next transaction.
//!       Repeat the process until the swap is satisfied.
//!
//! Each 'consumption' of the transaction is recoded as fragmentation.
//! For example, if a transaction has an output of 100 units, and a swap consumes 70 units, the transaction is fragmented into two parts:
//! 1. 70 units, consumed by the swap.
//! 2. 30 units, remaining for future swaps.
//!
//! The input amount of the original transaction & the output amount of the swap are fragmented in the same way.
